<h1 id="unique">Poonam’s Day Out 1</h1>
<p>
please let me go to school today, <span class="blue">I have been at home for
the past two days</span>. I am getting bored – said Poonam. But you
still have fever. Go outside and lie down on the cot – replied Ma.
Poonam fell asleep on the cot. Suddenly, something fell on her
face. Poonam woke up at once and touched her cheek. Oh no,
whose mischief is this? Is it the crow’s or the pigeon’s? It seems
it’s the crow's.

	<h1>The Plant Fairy 2</h1>
		<p>
Last Sunday, we went to a garden in the neighbourhood. We
played <span class="blue">Hide and Seek (Chhupanchhupai) and Antakshari.</span>
We had a lot of fun. After sometime, Didi said – Let us play a
new game today. We had played this game in the camp last
year. I will become a ‘Plant fairy’. The ‘Plant fairy’ will call out a
name of something and you all will have to touch it.

Water O’ Water ! 3

					<p>
I’ll wash my face with water,
Said Munna to his Nani.
We all quench our thirst with water,
We are all alive because of water.
Water has been with us for ages,
Its story can fill so many pages!
